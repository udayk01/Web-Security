This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie. The results of the SQL query are not returned.

The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. To solve the lab, find a way to leak the password for the administrator user, then log in to their account.
